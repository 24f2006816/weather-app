## Setup and Installation

To get WeatherWise up and running on your local machine, follow these simple steps:

1.  **Clone the Repository (if applicable)**:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd weatherwise
    ```

    *(Note: For this single-file output, you can directly save the `index.html` content to a file.)*

2.  **Obtain an OpenWeatherMap API Key**:

    *   Go to the [OpenWeatherMap website](https://openweathermap.org/).
    *   Sign up for a free account (if you don't have one).
    *   Navigate to your API keys section and generate a new API key.

3.  **Update `index.html` with your API Key**:

    *   Open the `index.html` file in a text editor.
    *   Locate the JavaScript section (`<script>` tag).
    *   Find the line `const API_KEY = 'YOUR_OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY';`.
    *   Replace `'YOUR_OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY'` with the actual API key you obtained from OpenWeatherMap.

    ```javascript
    // Before
    const API_KEY = 'YOUR_OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY';

    // After (example)
    const API_KEY = 'a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0k1l2m3n4o5p6'; 
    ```

4.  **Open `index.html` in your Browser**:

    *   Simply open the `index.html` file using your preferred web browser. You can usually do this by double-clicking the file.

## Usage

1.  **Enter City Name**: Type the name of the city you want to check the weather for into the input field.
2.  **Search**: Click the search button (magnifying glass icon) or press `Enter`.
3.  **View Weather**: The dashboard will update to display the current temperature, humidity, wind speed, weather description, and a dynamic icon for the specified city.
4.  **Error Messages**: If a city is not found or there's an API issue, a brief error message will appear.
